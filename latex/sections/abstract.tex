\noindent This report, crafted by Mia Synnøve Frivik, Andrea Myrvang, Max Jan Willem Schuringa, and Janita Ovidie Sandtrøen Willumsen, aims to explore the effects of different regression methods on data modeling, focusing on Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Ridge, and LASSO. Utilizing synthetic data from the Franke function. Our analysis puts a lens on how these regression methods handle various data types. Our goal is to ascertain how each method influences predictive modeling, particularly in identifying high-risk zones for events like avalanches and floods. We'll employ bias-variance trade-off analysis and cross-validation to rigorously evaluate our models' performances and ensure their reliability. Findings indicate that the choice of regression method highly depends on the the data set used for the analysis. 

% \noindent The aim of this report is to see how different regression method affects the data it is applied to. 
% More concretely, we will look at the three different methods ordinary least squares (OLS), Ridge and LASSO. 
% We will also apply bias variance trade of as well as cross validation on the data sets used to evaluate our models.
% What we found was that ... regression with parameter ... best fitted the topological data analysis...

\noindent The aim of this report is to study three different regression methods, ordinary least squares (OLS), Ridge and LASSO and see how these method compare to each other when applied to different data sets.

When plotted between 0 and 1 this function looks like a mountain and a valley, which is a perfect starting point when we later want to apply these methods on digital terrain data taken from \url{https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/}.

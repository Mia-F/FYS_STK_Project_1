\subsection{Result for Franke function}
\noindent Our initial step involved the application of OLS to the Franke function without noise
This analysis was conducted without employing any resampling techniques, 
and our dataset conisted of 100 data points. The results for the MSE and R2 score is shown in 
figure \eqref{MSE and R2 OLS}

	\label{MSE and R2 OLS}
\end{figure}
\noindent The next step was to include noise given by the normal distribution $\mathcal{N}(0,1)$. Figure \eqref{MSE and R2 OLS noise} shows
how the MSE and R2 score changes when noise is includet in to the data set.

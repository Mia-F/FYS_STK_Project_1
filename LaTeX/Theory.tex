\subsection{Bias-variance trade-off and resampling techniques}

\noindent The main restriction in machine learning is 
the amount of data points available to create the model out of. It may be the case where one have
done a costfull and time consuming experiments and are left with a small number of data. 
It is therfull extremely useful to have methods where one can reuse the data multiple times
therefore creating a relatively large dataset from the small number of datapoints. In this report
we are going to use to diffrent method the first is called bootstrap and the second one is cross validation.

\subsection{Bootstrap} 
\noindent The bootstrap method is a resampling procedure that uses data from one 
sample to generate a sampling distribution by repeatedly taking random 
samples from the known sample, with replacement\cite{PSU}

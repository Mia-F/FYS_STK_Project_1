abstract = {Determining the snow avalanche-prone areas is fundamental for risk mitigation in the snowy mountains of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, especially in the context of current climate warming. We use the Parlung Tsangpo catchment in southeastern Tibet as an example, collect 381 snow avalanches through field surveys. On this basis, two sample sets, three combinations of conditioning factor, and four machine learning algorithms involving Support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), Classification and Regression Tree (CART), and Multilayer perceptron (MLP) are compared to produce snow avalanche susceptibility maps. The Kappa coefficient and ROC curve are used for the accuracy test. The results show that four basic models all have good prediction capability, and the most robust one is SVM, while the comparative sample set and two comparative combinations of factors underperform. The high snow avalanche-prone areas are mainly distributed at the Ranwu-Yupu section along the National Road 318 in the upper narrow valley section of Parlung Tsangpo River, the ridges of the mountains on both sides of the middle and lower reaches, and the narrow valley sections of the tributaries. The finding not only verifies the applicability of these four machine learning algorithms in the snow avalanche susceptibility mapping, but also points out the key areas for the local snow avalanche disaster reduction and prevention. This study can provide a good reference for other snowy mountainous regions lacking well-documents of snow avalanches.}

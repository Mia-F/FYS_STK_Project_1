# FYS-STK3155/4155 Project 1

## Regression Analysis and Resampling Methods
- [Assignment](https://compphysics.github.io/MachineLearning/doc/LectureNotes/_build/html/project1.html)

### Requirements
To run the python programs, the following python packages must be installed
- numpy
- mathplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn
- tqdm
- imageio

### Reproducing results
Run the code, and produce the plots, from the root directory  
```bash
cd code
python3 main.py
```
### Comments
The code used to produce plots during project development, is located in `code/draft/`. Most of the implementations have
been moved into separate files in `code/`, however, heat plot and 3D visualizations have not yet been fixed.
